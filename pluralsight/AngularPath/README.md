### Why a new Angular?

  - Built for speed

  - Modern (takes advantage of latest JS standards)

### Anatomy of an Angular Application

An application is comprised of a set of components and services that provide services across those components

#### Angular Component
 
  1. Template - user interface fragment, defining the view

  2. Class - code associated with the view (properties/data elements, methods)

  3. Metadata - providing additional information about the component to Angular

#### Angular Modules

  - help us organize our application into cohesive blocks of functionality

  - every Angular application has at least one module (root)
